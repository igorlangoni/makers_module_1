# Review Your Learning

In this chapter, you worked towards seven of the module's ten learning
objectives:

* Execute Python code in two different ways
* Make a plan using problem decomposition and experimentation
* Describe and use variables
* Describe and use conditionals
* Describe and use control flow
* Describe and use methods and functions
* Build programs using all of the above!

If a lot of these topics were new to you, it's very much worth taking 15 minutes
to review them. Use the following questions to guide you and, if you get stuck,
reach out to one of your peers – that will allow them to further test
themselves.

1. Name two ways of executing Python code.
2. How are functions defined?
3. When would a method or a function take an argument?
4. What is the basic structure of an if statement?
5. What is refactoring?
6. What is the difference between for and while loops?

After this, jump on to [Chapter 2](../chapter2/README.md)
