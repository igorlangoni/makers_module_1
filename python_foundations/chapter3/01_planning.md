# Planning Password Manager 2.0

As the lead developer on Password Manager 2.0, you have a lot of responsibility
and a large backlog of work. The first step, as always, is to consider the new
requirements and what you'll need to learn in order to complete them.

## Learning Plan

At the moment, passwords are stored in a simple dictionary where each
service-password combination is stored as a key-value pair. If we want to track
when a password was added and updated, we'll need to consider alternative data
structures and learn how to choose between them.

The other tasks will require us to learn more about Dictionaries and Lists. For
example, if we want to validate that a password is unique, we'll have to compare
it with all the other currently stored passwords.
