# Review Your Learning

In this chapter, you've worked towards all ten of the module's learning
objectives.

* Execute Python code in two different ways
* Make a plan using problem decomposition and experimentation
* Describe and use variables
* Describe and use conditionals
* Describe and use lists
* Describe and use dictionaries
* Describe and use loops to go through collections
* Describe and use methods & functions
* Describe and use classes
* Build programs using all of the above!

Please take 15 minutes to review them now. Use the following questions to guide you (some of which will relate to learning objectives from previous chapters) and, if you get stuck, reach out to one of your peers – that will allow them to further test themselves.

1. Which data structure did you choose and why?
2. How did your choice of data structure impact on your implementation of Password Manager 2?
3. What is a for loop?
4. Why are for loops useful?
5. What is the difference between printing to the terminal and returning a value?
6. What is problem decomposition?
7. How do use `list comprehension` on a List?
8. How do use `dictionary comprehension` on a Dictionary?

Done before the end of the two weeks? If so, proceed onto the [Extension Challenges](../README.md#Extension-Challenges)!
