# Screen Recordings

At various points in the bootcamp you'll be asked to make a screen recording so that your coach can give you feedback on your programming process.

## Making a Screen Recording

Here's how to make a screen recording, using Zoom.

1. Open your text editor and get ready to do some programming
2. Start a new meeting
3. Decide whether you want your camera on or off - if it's on, you'll appear in the screen recording
4. Go to `Share Screen` and select your text editor (don't share your whole desktop)
5. Click on `Record` and, if prompted, choose to save the recording locally
6. You should now be ready to go!

And here's the same process in [video form](https://youtu.be/Hi3uzKsqbAU).

### Do
- Show your planning process
- Narrate your work by thinking out, if you feel comfortable doing that
- Review your own video and reflect on it

### Don't
- Worry about mistakes when recording, just keep going :)
