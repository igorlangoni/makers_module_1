# Problem Decomposition

## Intro

As you progress through the course and, indeed, through your career as a Software Developer, you'll come across increasingly difficult problems. As that happens, your ability to tackle problems all at once will lessen and you might begin to feel overwhelmed.

**This is incredibly common, and is not indicative of your true ability.**

We could look at hundreds of metaphors and analogies from sports teams, working together to break down solutions, to Construction workers & Architects planning and blueprinting, to Detectives or Investigative Journalists applying methodical approaches.

But today we're going to talk about Cake

## Russian Naturalism & Cake

Stanislavski was a Russian Theatre practitioner who revolutionised drama, but he also came up with a very handy analogy for tackling big problems.

Stanislavski said, when you are facing a large problem or task (in his case characters & plays, in our case Programs & Requirements), you could think of it as a Cake.

When attempting to eat a Cake, one does not simply walk up to it and attempt to stuff the entire dessert into one's mouth. It would be unachievable and you'll likely choke.

Instead, you might try slicing the cake into sections. How large or small the sections, is entirely up to you. When beginning this process, it's natural to start off with smaller slices, working methodically through the Cake (Problem/Program).

As you progress in your Cake swallowing abilities, you're able to judge larger slices.

But! Should you ever feel dissuaded at the size of the slice you have cut for yourself, fear not - for one can always cut that slice down further too.

And so could we approach a larger problem in Software Development.

This tendency to break things up into component parts will come more naturally as you move further into the course and come to utilise Test Driven Development, but for now, let's look at our problem, and dissect, or Decompose, it into more manageable chunks.

## Practising Problem Decomposition

Getting good at problem decomposition takes practice, so let's do that now. The following two exercises are intended to train your ability to break things down into tiny, very simple, steps. Later on, you'll be given a specific approach to decomposing the type of problems that you'll encounter over the next few weeks.

## Sorting a Deck of Cards

Imagine that you're giving instructions to another person how to do this. They have the deck of cards spread out in front of them, face down, and they're only allowed to have two cards flipped at any one time.

> If you can break this down into steps, you'll probably then be able to translate your steps into code, but I would advise you to use numbers rather than cards :)

## Checking for Duplicates

Once again, imagine you're giving instructions to another person. This time their task is to check for duplicates in a deck of cards – perhaps someone is suspected of cheating?

Again, the deck of cards is in front of them, spread out face down, and they can only have two cards flipped at any one time.

> If you can break this down into steps, you'll probably then be able to translate your steps into code, but I would advise you to use numbers rather than cards :)

## Get Feedback

To get feedback on one of the card related problems, use your solution to direct someone else in performing the task. Note that they can only do exactly what you've written.
