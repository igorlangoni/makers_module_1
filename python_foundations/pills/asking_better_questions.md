# How to ask for help 🙏

These are a few guidelines around asking for help with a problem with your code. Often just following this process can give you a clue as to what is going wrong, it can help you to:
  * clarify the problem in your own mind 🧠
  * explain the problem in a way that others can understand quickly and easily 🗣️

## The 5 Parts of a Great Request for Help 🏳️

### Part 1: What are you trying to do? 🤔

Give a little context. What is the outcome you are trying to achieve? Why is this outcome useful?

### Part 2:  What do you expect to happen? 🚀

If there were no problems whatsoever, what would you expect to happen? How would you know whether or not this had happened?

### Part 3. What is actually happening? 💥

What is the actual outcome? What error is being raised? What information have you learned from that error? What do you think it means?

### Part 4. What have you tried so far? 📋

What have you searched for so far? What terms did you put into the search engine? What potential solutions have you tried already? What led you to that solution? Did you learn anything from trying it?

### Part 5. A minimal example 🛹

This will be the smallest amount of code you can share that still exhibits the problem. Comment out other tests & methods, make sure the error is still happening, and then share the remaining code in your request. You can use slack code blocks by entering three backticks: ```.

## Final Thoughts 💬

Quite often, if you assemble a help request in this manner, you’ll get an idea about the solution (particularly the minimal example step). If not, it gives the person who you’re asking help from a lightning-fast way to understand the problem, try it out themselves, and get an idea of what you might be misunderstanding. This is true while on the course, but is especially important when working in a real-world development team.
