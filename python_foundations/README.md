# Python Foundations

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/foundations/python/DESIGN.x.md)_

## Learning objectives

In this section, you will learn the fundamentals of Python and how to write
simple programs using it. You will also learn higher level engineering skills
like problem decomposition, debugging, and using a REPL (more on this later).

#### By the end of the module, you will be able to

* Execute Python code in two different ways
* Make a plan using problem decomposition and experimentation
* Describe and use variables
* Describe and use conditionals
* Describe and use lists
* Describe and use dictionaries
* Describe and use loops to go through collections
* Describe and use methods & functions
* Describe and use classes
* Build programs using all of the above!

## Structure

<!-- OMITTED -->

There are three chapters to work through. These chapters are broken up into
sections (pages).

The first chapter introduces a range of new concepts. These are then built on in
the later chapters. This process of introducing a topic and then revisiting it
later is called _spiral learning_.

As you progress you will be given challenges. You should complete these before
moving on. There are two types of challenge:

* **Drills**  
  Drills are a series of tightly focused and repetitive exercises designed to
  help you become familiar with the basic building blocks of programming.

  We'll ask you to zip up and share your solutions to these exercises so
  that your coach can understand how you're doing.

* **Programs**  
  Programs require you to bring these basic building blocks together to build a
  useful program.

  We'll ask you to make a screen recording of yourself working on these
  challenges so that your coach can understand how you're doing.

## Sequence

Work through these chapters one at a time.

1. [Password Validator](./chapter1/README.md)
2. [Password Manager](./chapter2/README.md)
3. [Password Manager 2.0](./chapter3/README.md)

## Extension Challenges

If you want to stretch yourself, there are some extra extended challenges 
available to help reinforce your learning:

* [Loading and saving files](./extension_challenges/01_files/README.md)
* [Parsing JSON content](./extension_challenges/02_json/README.md)
