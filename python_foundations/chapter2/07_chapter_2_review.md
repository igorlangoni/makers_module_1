# Review Your Learning

In this section, you've worked towards all ten of this module's learning
objectives:

* Execute Python code in two different ways
* Make a plan using problem decomposition and experimentation
* Describe and use variables
* Describe and use conditionals
* Describe and use lists
* Describe and use dictionaries
* Describe and use loops to go through collections
* Describe and use methods & functions
* Describe and use classes
* Build programs using all of the above!

Please take 15 minutes to review them now. Use the following questions to guide
you and, if you get stuck, reach out to one of your peers — that will allow them
to further test themselves.

1. How do you create and add items to a List?
2. How do you create and add items to a Dictionary?
3. List two differences between Lists and Dictionaries.
4. How do you define a class?
5. What is the difference between a class and an instance of a class?
6. What is meant by scope?

After this, jump on to [Chapter 3](../chapter3/README.md)
